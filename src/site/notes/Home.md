### About Me
Greetings! I'm Gamilar, a multi-faceted individual with a passion for life's diverse experiences.

I currently live near Exeter with my beloved wife; I suffered a stroke in 2018, and it took me about a year to recover. Moving to Devon had been a benefit as it helped to relieve my stress levels, and it allowed us to be closer to our grandkids (which was a bonus).

### My Hobbies
> [!columns|no-t 3]
>> <h4><center>Ballroom and Latin American Dance</center></h4>
>> 
>> Dance isn't just a hobby; it's an way of life for my wife and I. Whilst I was studying at the University of Sheffield, an associate of mine recommended that I join the club since it was held in the same hall as my hall of residencies. So I never looked back from then on, joining the team to compete; I met (and married) my wife through dancing, we went competing together, and we got involved promoting events and competitions.
>
>> <h4><center>Gaming</center></h4>
>> 
>> I've been gaming since I was a teenager. Most British players have started with either the Fighting Fantasy or the Lone Wolf books. At one time or another, I have played and run games with Dungeons & Dragons, Runequest, Rolemaster, GURPS, Savage Worlds, True20, Dragonbane, and Pathfinder.
>
>> <h4><center>Geek Culture</center></h4>
>> 
>> Yep, I'm a Geek (or Nerd) - and I'm proud of my Geekiness. I enjoy anything from Fantasy to Sci-Fi, from comics to videos, from online games to tech innovations. I pop along to the local Comic Con each week and, just recently, I found [Clifton Road Games](https://www.cliftonroadgames.co.uk/), a gaming shop between both my home and my office. It now means that I can now fulfil my gaming addiction as a player and as a gamemaster.

####  Campaign 3: Mysteries on the Kindred Coast: Rusthenge
![banner_rusthenge.webp|banner p+t hsmall](/img/user/z_Assets/Banners/banner_rusthenge.webp)
> The ruins of Rusthenge have stood silent vigil over the southern coastline of Chakikoth Isle for eons, dating back to the era of the Runelords of ancient Thassilon. The town of Iron Harbour was built in Rusthenge's shadow, but now that New Thassilon has risen from the depths of the distant past, the old ruins are coming under unexpected scrutiny. Something sinister is afoot in Rusthenge, and it falls to a brand new band of adventurers to learn the truth of the ancient evil that stirs deep within its long-abandoned halls!

*This adventure also includes new items, character backgrounds, and a pair of new monsters tied to the region's notorious history.*
**3-5 players, Pathfinder 2E Remastered**

Session 0 will be Monday 3rd February @ 7pm.

####  Campaign 2: Menace under Otari / Abomination Vaults \<ARCHIVED\>
![banner_abomination-vaults.jpg|banner p+t hsmall](/img/user/z_Assets/Banners/banner_abomination-vaults.jpg)
The heroes found a set of underground caverns that hosted a tribe of kobolds with a large pet, intending to cause havoc to the town of Otari. After dealing with their pet, the group took some time to relax before [[Mechanics/Bestiaries/Adventure Paths/Abomination Vaults/Wrin Sivinxi\|Wrin Sivinxi]] asked for some help to find out what was causing the strange lights in the Fogfen marshes.

> [!failure] Infomation
> Well, I've lost two players to another game; and I've just lost a third to his hectic work.
> I won't be at the shop until the New Year whilst I focus on sorting various things.
> I will be restarting the game then, so hopefully some of my players will be up for it.

#### Campaign 1: The Undying War \<ARCHIVED\>
![cover_theundyingwar.jpg|banner p+tc htiny](/img/user/z_Assets/Covers/cover_theundyingwar.jpg)

 I have previously run a Savage Worlds campaign at [Clifton Road Games](https://www.cliftonroadgames.co.uk/), that ran most Monday evenings. Due to personal reasons, the group were not able to keep playing but you can relive the excitement of past sessions! You can explore archives of our gaming adventures, complete with session recaps, character profiles, and memorable moments. Whether you're a fellow player or just curious about our escapades, you can dive into the archives!
